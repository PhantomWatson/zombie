<div class="fake_pic">
	Backstage, completely dark
</div>
<p>
	You poke your head backstage and can't see much at all. You decide that it's a better idea to go back
	and try to find a flashlight somewhere instead of stumbling into the shadows and not even knowing what the
	hell is eating your face off.
